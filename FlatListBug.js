This React Native bug involves unexpected behavior when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  The issue manifests as intermittent crashes or freezes, particularly on lower-end devices.  The root cause is likely related to inefficient rendering or memory management within the `FlatList` component, exacerbated by complex item components and a large number of items.  The problem becomes more noticeable as the number of items increases and when the items themselves require significant rendering work, leading to dropped frames and performance degradation. The app can even crash in the worst scenario.  There is no clear error message, only performance issues which indicate a memory leak somewhere in the flatlist.
